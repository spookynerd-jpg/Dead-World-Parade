Nullification Field: Your greatest spellwork. You are immune to all Magic, and weapons that strike you lose any Enhancements.

Silence the Lambs: Finally, some peace and quiet. Target a player; Server Deafen them in Discord. They cannot use any Action Abilities from Gifts while this effect is active, only Basic Attacks. Only one target may be Silenced this way at a time.
