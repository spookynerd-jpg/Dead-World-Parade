# Lorde Karst Drakkona

When the skies of Arca burned, the Last King of Man stood resolute against the end from within his Walled City. That was, until one of his closest advisers, the Lorde of the very city itself, revealed his machination. Karst Drakkona was no man; he was the great King of Dragons, and he stood atop the highest parapet, humanityâ€™s last hope dripping red from the tips of his claws. The city is his now, claimed for dragon and kin, the last remnant of humanity claimed by something greater.
