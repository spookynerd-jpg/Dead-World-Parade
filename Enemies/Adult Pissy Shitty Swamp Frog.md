# Adult Frog Demon
Residing in the unfavorable climes of the Pissy Shitty Swamp, these creatures coat themselves in the rancid poison of the bog to fend of predators&ndash; and swiftly dispatch their prey.
Their seeming ability to coordinate movements to box in prey lead some to speculate of a greater intelligence, though all reports are anecdotal.

Abilities work on standard Sentiment AI. Attribute chosen by highest Attribute Bonus at the start of every Act.

Anura Terribilis: Any character who makes physical contact with your flesh takes Poison equal to your Swing.

Labored Leap: [Action] [Green] Leap into the air, crashing down on the last creature to make an Attack against you. They, alongside any other creatures caught under your mass, must Roll to Dye or take Swing + 2d6 Damage and Poison, dodging out of the way on success. Place up to 5 spaces of Pissy Shitty Swamp adjacent to yourself on landing. Any creatures hit are trapped beneath your weight, and must make a Roll to Do DC 25 to escape at the start of their turn. Trapped characters are freed upon movement or repeat execution of this Action.

The Lick: [Action] [Black] Ranged Attack. On hit, increase target's Poison up to 50. Spawn up to 3 spaces of Pissy Shitty Swamp along the path of the tongue. Target's Poison is not altered if above 50.

Gulp Down: [Action] [Gold] Make a Contested Roll against the closest creature. On success, they are Swallowed Whole, being immobilized inside your stomach. Swallowed Whole creatures take Poison as if in constant Pissy Shitty Swamp, alongside taking damage equal to your Swing, at the start of every Act.   
If a Swallowed Whole character perishes, their bloodstain, if applicable, is left inside your stomach, and can only be retrieved through your death.
